Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). 
the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent 
binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

Logistic Regression is used in Deep Learning 

This repository aims to implement the logistic regression algorithm in Python
